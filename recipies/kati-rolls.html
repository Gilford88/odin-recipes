    <h1>Nadia's Kati Rolls</h1>

    <p>Kati rolls are a common street food back in my parents’ homeland, where they are often filled with grilled meats and piquant salads. Keen to make a vegetarian version of the delicious kati roll at home, here I’ve filled a crisp egg-fried tortilla with creamy spinach and paneer. It makes a great snack or something to eat on the side. There is something about that vibrant green that makes me pleased it’s not in smoothie form!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>226 paneer</li>
            <li>150g spinach leaves</li>
            <li>150ml water</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>    
            <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chilli flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch sale</li>
            <li>4 small tortilla wraps</li>
            </ul>
     
        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Put a non-stick saucepan on a medium heat with 2 tablespoons of the oil. As soon as the oil is hot, add the paneer and fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want to colour the paneer as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Put the spinach leaves and water into a blender and whiz to a smooth paste. Add a splash more water if needed, to blend smoothly.</li>
            <li>Take the paneer out of the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the garlic to the pan and cook for a minute, until the garlic is light brown.</li>
            <li>Add the green mixture, along with the cumin seeds, chilli flakes and salt, and cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes, until some of the water from around the edge has reduced and the mixture has thickened.</li>
            <li>Add the paneer to the pan and mix well, making sure all the cheese is covered in green. Pop a lid on the pan and leave on a low heat while you make the rolls.</li>
            <li>Put a small frying pan on a high heat and add a good glug of oil, enough to cover the base.</li>
            <li>Break the eggs into a very shallow bowl with the salt and lightly whisk – the bowl needs to be flat enough to be able to dunk the tortillas. Dip a tortilla into the egg mixture, making sure to cover it all over. Get it straight into the frying pan. The oil should be hot enough to really create a sizzle. Cook for just 30 seconds, then turn it over and cook on the other side. Now cook the other 3 tortillas the same way.</li>
            <li>To serve, add the paneer mixture to the centre of a hot crispy tortilla, and roll up. Not like a burrito, but the way a kid would make a roll for the first time. If you don’t have cheese falling out one end, you’re doing it wrong!</li>
        </ol>
